# Ven-Diagram
Given 3 sets and their union create a 3 circle diagram

Unlike most programming the SVG Path tag is very fusy about white spaces.

=C3^2*ACOS((B9^2+C3^2-C2^2)/(2*B9*C3))+C2^2*ACOS((B9^2+C2^2-C3^2)/(2*B9*C2))-0.5*SQRT((-B9+C3+C2)*(B9+C3-C2)*(B9-C3+C2)*(B9+C3+C2))
the area of the union where B9 is the distance between the centers and C2 is the radius of circle A and C3 is the radius of circle B
