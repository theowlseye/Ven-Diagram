# Venn Diagram
Given 3 sets and their union create a 3 circle diagram

Unlike most programming the SVG Path tag is very fusy about white spaces.

=C3^2xACOS((B9^2+C3^2-C2^2)/(2xB9xC3))+C2^2xACOS((B9^2+C2^2-C3^2)/(2xB9xC2))-0.5xSQRT((-B9+C3+C2)x(B9+C3-C2)x(B9-C3+C2)x(B9+C3+C2))
the area of the union where B9 is the distance between the centers and C2 is the radius of circle A and C3 is the radius of circle B

I haven't started using this formula.  I am still trying to Master drawing shapes.
